### Textbook: [R for Political Data Science](https://www.routledge.com/R-for-Political-Data-Science-A-Practical-Guide/Urdinez-Cruz/p/book/9780367818890) / [AnalizaR Datos Pol√≠ticos](/libroadp/index.html)

*Co-edited with [Francisco Urdinez](https://www.furdinez.com)* 

A textbook that introduces R and the `tidyverse` from scratch using examples from Latin American political science.

### Course: [Programming for the Social Sciences](https://arcruz0.github.io/r-uc-2020/)

From 2019 to 2021 I taught a computational social science class for undergraduate students at [UDP](https://socialesehistoria.udp.cl/carreras/ciencia-politica/) and [PUC](http://cienciapolitica.uc.cl/). The link above has class materials for the 2020 edition at PUC (in Spanish).

### R packages: 

- [`inexact`](https://www.github.com/arcruz0/inexact): supervise fuzzy joins, i.e., joins where the ID variables are not fully standardized. See my [slides](/extra/toronto2021/inexact_slides.html) for the Toronto Workshop on Reproducibility.

- [`tesseractgt`](https://github.com/arcruz0/tesseractgt): generate "ground truth" data for retraining or fine-tuning Tesseract's optical character recognition (OCR) neural network. See the [blog post](/posts/finetuning-tess/index.html).

- [`rlazycartesian`](https://arcruz0.github.io/extra/rlazycartesian/): efficiently extract elements from Cartesian Products. Partial wrapper of the [`lazy-cartesian-product`](https://github.com/tylerburdsall/lazy-cartesian-product) C++ library.
