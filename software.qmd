- [`marginaleffectsjax`](https://github.com/arcruz0/marginaleffectsJAX): replace [`marginaleffects`](https://marginaleffects.com/) derivatives with automatic differentiation, via JAX.

- [`tesseractgt`](https://github.com/arcruz0/tesseractgt): generate "ground truth" data for retraining or fine-tuning Tesseract's optical character recognition (OCR) neural network.

- [`rlazycartesian`](https://arcruz0.github.io/extra/rlazycartesian/): extract elements from Cartesian Products. Partial wrapper of the [`lazy-cartesian-product`](https://github.com/tylerburdsall/lazy-cartesian-product) C++ library.

- [`inexact`](https://www.github.com/arcruz0/inexact): supervise fuzzy joins, i.e., joins where the ID variables are not fully standardized. See my [slides](/extra/toronto2021/inexact_slides.html) for the Toronto Workshop on Reproducibility.
