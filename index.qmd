Hi! I am a graduate student at UT Austin, where I am pursuing a PhD in Government and an MS in Statistics. I am broadly interested in computational social science and applications in comparative politics.

Previously, I was a full-time RA on a household finance project led by Erik Berwart (CMF), Sean Higgins (Northwestern), Sheisha Kulkarni (UVa), and Santiago Truffa (UAndes). I received a BA and MA in Political Science from Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile.
