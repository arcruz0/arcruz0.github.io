Hi! I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Government at the University of Texas at Austin, where I also obtained an MS in Statistics. 

I am a methodologist interested in what makes an empirical result *robust*, and what analyses can sustain such a claim. I draw from statistics and machine learning to develop interpretable sensitivity tools for social science.

Previously, I received a BA and MA in Political Science from Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile.
